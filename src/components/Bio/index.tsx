                    Full Stack Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing, building, and optimizing scalable applications across modern tech stacks and cloud platforms. I specialize in full-stack development, cloud architecture, and API integrations, bringing a user-centered approach to solving complex engineering challenges.

                    With a background in the nonprofit sector, I'm passionate about accessibility, inclusive design, and building software that creates real, measurable impact.
